There has been a [lively discussion](//storify.com/gilesdring/flood-resilience)
about flood-resilient design, and approaches businesses took to renovation
after the 2012 floods. The key is to create hardwearing surfaces which can
be cleaned and dried rapidly, and to ensure that the building services are
well positioned.

This is work in progress, designed to prompt discussion. Please feedback using the button at the bottom of the page.

# Flooring

Concrete floors, and give thought think about how to sluice down to doorways.
Polished concrete or tiled surfaces and skirtings, not wood or MDF.

Element Jewellery invested in concrete floors after the floods in 2012, as
their former floor was seriously affected.

Others repaired damaged floors in 2012 with a solid concrete base with tiles.
These have survived the recent floods.

At least one residential property reported having concrete floors with a waxed,
environmentally friendly linoleum. This proved highly flood resistant, and was
easily cleaned.

Any woodwork could be treated with boat varnish.

# Walls

Lime plaster to lower surfaces not regular plaster or plasterboard.

Other treatments include replacing brick with breeze blocks and waterproofing
then cladding with a (cheap) wood designed to be ripped out in the
event of flood damage.

# Services (electrics, comms and gas)

Place site meters and distribution boards as high as possible - this will be
dependent on 'tail' lengths left on the incoming feed. Place sockets as high
up as possible and feed from above.

Identify and alter low level air vents, electrical and communications entry
points.

# Shop display

There's some thinking around shop design around how to display stock whilst
allowing for quick removal and storage of paper based materials.

Shelving securely fitted to walls.

# Stockroom and Admin

Upstairs, if at all possible.
