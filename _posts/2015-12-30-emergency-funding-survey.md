We have been in contact with Calderdale MBC in relation to an application for
central government emergency funding. We need to gather information about the
extent of the impact on local businesses in the Upper Valley. We've created a
short survey which will give us what we need to put the case together. There
is some urgency for applications, so we need as many surveys as possible to be
completed by lunchtime on 31st December.

This was [previously published in a mailshot](http://eepurl.com/bLpgfb) to the
Hebden Bridge Business Forum mailing list.
