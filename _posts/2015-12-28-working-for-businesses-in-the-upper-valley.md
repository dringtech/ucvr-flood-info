Dear Business Colleagues,

The unprecedented Boxing Day floods have caused such serious damage to businesses across the Upper Calder Valley that some of our most financially vulnerable businesses are at serious risk. The high-profile funds being raised by Community Foundation For Calderdale are not designated for business relief. They are for domestic home flood victims.

As a consequence, we are co-ordinating an initiative to let businesses speak
with one united and strong voice to both Local and National Government.  Under
one valley-wide initiative under the umbrella of the
[Upper Calder Valley Renaissance](http://ucvr.org.uk) we are joining forces
with the [Hebden Bridge](https://www.facebook.com/hebdenbridgebusinessforum/),
[Todmorden](https://twitter.com/TBNTodBusNetwk) and Mytholmroyd business groups to do a number of things:

* We will gather details from along the valley of the immediate general needs
  of businesses.
* We will make strong and informed representation to the authorities on behalf
  of the business community.
* From the above we will seek realistic long-term funding to help all
  businesses in need.
* We will seek interim funding to begin the job of a gathering information to
  plan for a full recovery of the local economy.

We already have the support of Calderdale Metropolitan Borough Council in this initiative. We have also called on the many professionals in the Valley to pledge some voluntary skills time to ensure we have the best possible PR and promotions for the valley for business recovery. We may ask for specialist help from some of you where appropriate.

We just wanted you all to know that the businesses will not be forgotten once the fantastic, practical volunteer army has completed its clean up support.

It will take time but we will begin to bring those who can offer financial support to the table sooner rather than later.

We hope you will support this initiative. We will keep you informed of progress.
