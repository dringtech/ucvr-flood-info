Business for Calderdale have launched a [crowdfunding initiative][CRC] aimed at raising money for businesses.
This will be run as a collaborative effort, with all participant businesses sharing in the proceeds of the fund. Pledges can be made on the fund web page at [crowdfunder.co.uk/calderdalerising][CRC].

[CRC]: http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/calderdalerising

The initial application deadline was Tuesday 12th January. Any businesses successful in applying to join this initiative will have an equal full share in the proceeds. The date has since been **extended until 5.00pm Tuesday 19th January**, with successful businesses being onboarded on Friday 22nd January. Any subsequent businesses will each take a half-share (i.e. half the amount of the businesses in the initial tranche).

Businesses interested in participating for this should urgently
**send an email to <kirsty@thecfn.org.uk>**
to register your interest and receive an application form.

The detailed criteria will be sent out to you once you have contacted Kirsty, but in summary, businesses must have been materially affected by the floods, and must be willing to use their social media channels (or customer mailing lists) to send out a set number of updates related to the funds.

If you are a business without an active social media presence, please contact us and we will endeavour to put you in touch with some mentors who can help you out.
