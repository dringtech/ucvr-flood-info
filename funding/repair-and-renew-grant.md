title: Repair and Renew Grant
---

Calderdale Council have announced a repair and renew grant, available for
domestic and business properties alike. Further details are available on
the [Calderdale business flood recovery website][CALDERDALE_BIZ_SUPPORT].

This grant covers up to £5,000 of work which will either help reduce the damage
that future floods cause, or will make it simpler to clean up and dry up.

A number of suggestions are given on this and other pages. These are summarised
on the [Flood Resilience resources page](/resources/flood-resilience/) elsewhere
on this site.

The Calderdale site includes a [Guidance document][GUIDANCE_DOC] which outlines
the criteria under which the grants can be applied for.
It also contains a set of potential measures with indicative costs.

There is information available about preparation on the National Flood Forum
[Property Level Protection Community Tool][PLPCT],
including the [Flood protection adviser][FPA]. It should be noted that this
provides only general advice, and any application must be accompanied with a
professional survey which typically costs £500. This can be claimed back as
part of the grant. We are working on a list of local surveyors able to complete
this work.

The Calderdale site also hosts the [application form][APPLICATION_FORM], which
asks for details of the work. We are exploring the possibility of partially
pre-filled forms to simplify the process for business owners.

Applications can be made up to 31st March 2016, and work should be completed
before 30th September 2016. The council will consider retrospective
applications for work undertaken, although it is clearly preferable to get
be better to get advice in advance.
