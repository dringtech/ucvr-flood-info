Welcome to the Upper Calder Valley Renaissance Flood Coordination page.
This site has been set up in response to the floods which affected the
Upper Calder Valley, including Todmorden, Hebden Bridge, Mytholmroyd and surrounding settlements.

This is work in progress, so please alert us to any additional or incorrect
information on the site. Our {% include icon-twitter.html username="ucvr_" text="twitter account" %} is the best route.
