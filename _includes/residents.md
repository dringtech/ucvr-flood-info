## Residents affected by the floods

If you are a resident affected by the floods, you can apply for emergency
funding at the [Community Foundation for Calderdale](http://www.cffc.co.uk/).
This fund provides emergency relief grants to people whose homes have been flooded, to meet the immediate financial burdens of moving out, pumping and drying, and emergency repairs.
