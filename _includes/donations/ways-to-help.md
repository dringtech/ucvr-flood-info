For now, the local community is pulling together to get the region back on its
feet. If you're not local, you are best advised not to travel to the area
without a good reason in the immediate future. We will welcome you back when
we're up and running again.

In the meantime, you can directly help by donating to one of the funds.
A fund has been created for residents affected by the floods. Please donate to
the
[Community Foundation for Calderdale](https://localgiving.com/appeal/Flooding).
You can donate in person at {% include icon-twitter.html username="harveyshalifax" text="Harveys Department Store" %} in Halifax.
